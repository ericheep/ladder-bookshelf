# ladder-spectra

This project is pulling me out of statis.

It uses practically all of the creative coding skills that I've acquired over my artistic life.

ChucK is used for serial communication to the Arduinos and recieves OSC communication from Max/MSP.
Max/MSP is used for composition and generative / algorithmic processes that control the three Arduinos and 18 solenoids.
Python is used for analyzing the spectra and deciphering the prevelant harmonics of the harmonic plates.
My more recent studies of various tuning systems play into the algorithmic composition I'm creating based off analyzed harmonics of the various plates.
Plus many other random skills; crimping, soldering, 3D printing, mechatronic actuation, and PCB design.

In the end, it's really just the organized sound of a collection of metal plates that were origanally meant to be a ladder bookshelf, hence the name.

Ultimately, the processes do no matter. I only mention it because of the psychological impact it's had on me and many others - I am an artist, COVID and layoffs and the shitstorm that was 2020-2022 put me and many others in a state where we were scared to create for ourselves again (instead I was lucky enough to create for capital). Creating themed experiences is a great profession, but I must expect more from myself.

I hope brushing off these cobwebs lessen the distance from myself and the art I was meant to create during my time here.
